dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. 
Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; 
if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, 
it cannot be used as a key. You canâ€™t use lists as keys, 
since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like 
append() and extend().
